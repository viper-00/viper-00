### Hello, developers ðŸ‘‹

I am Viper, a highly experienced developer with a background in blockchain, Web3, NFT, DeFi, and wallet-related projects. I am proficient in various programming languages, including Golang, JS/TS, React, Solidity, Python, and Shell.

Currently, I am part of the Aurtech development team, working as a full-stack engineer, and we have launched several products: Aurpay, Aurbyt, and AurMask.

- [Aurpay](https://aurpay.net): This product enables merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments. It currently supports multiple blockchains such as BITCOIN, ETHEREUM, TRON, BSC, and various payment currencies like ETH, BTC, TRX, USDT, USDC, DAI, and BNB. The e-Commerce plugins developed by us are compatible with platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, Ecwid, BigCommerce, Opencart, and Prestashop. We have over 300 registered merchants, with around 100 active merchants.

- Aurbyt: This product allows end-users to purchase stablecoins like USDC and supports all mainstream blockchains. We collaborated with the US service provider [Cricle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) to develop this cryptocurrency payment wallet. Aurbyt enables fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto transactions and supports user KYC verification.

- AurMask: This is a wallet that supports both same-chain and cross-chain transactions. It connects to Uniswap's exchange contract, leveraging its vast market liquidity. Additionally, we have developed a set of cross-chain transaction methods, enabling currency exchange both within the same blockchain and across different blockchains.

During my free time, I also work on personal projects, striving to improve myself while making humble contributions to the Web3 ecosystem:

- [Nowcoin](https://nowcoin.info): This project involves Telegram notifications and a block scanning service, setting up a platform for message alerts and notifications. Regular users can provide their addresses, and when funds are received in their accounts, they will receive notifications through third-party tools like email, Telegram, etc. The service ensures real-time updates with no delays and allows users to monitor the latest cryptocurrency price movements and market trends. (Beta version now)

If your team is interested in having me on board, please send me an email, and I will reply during my free time. Thank you! ðŸ˜Š
