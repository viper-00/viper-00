### Hello, Developers ðŸ‘‹

I am Viper, a highly experienced developer with a background in blockchain, Web3, NFT, DeFi, and wallet-related projects. I am proficient in various programming languages, including Golang, JS/TS, Rust, Python, Solidity, and Shell.

I used to be a part of the Aurtech development team and working as a full-stack engineer. We have launched several products: Aurpay, Aurbyt, AurMask, AllInOne, and Aorbit.

- [Aurpay](https://aurpay.net): This product enables merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments. It supports multiple blockchains such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Lightning Network, Ethereum, Tron, BSC, and various payment currencies like BTC, BTC_LN, ETH, TRX, USDT, USDC, DAI, and BNB. Our e-commerce plugins are compatible with platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, Ecwid, BigCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, and Paid Memberships Pro. We have over 4,000 registered merchants, with around 500 active.

- Aurbyt: This product allows end-users to purchase stablecoins like USDC and supports all mainstream blockchains. We collaborated with the US service provider [Cricle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) to develop this cryptocurrency payment wallet. Aurbyt enables fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto transactions and supports user KYC verification.

- [AurMask](https://aurmask.net/): This wallet supports both same-chain and cross-chain transactions. It connects to Uniswap's exchange contract, leveraging its extensive market liquidity. Additionally, we have developed a set of cross-chain transaction methods, enabling currency exchanges both within the same blockchain and across different blockchains.

- [AllInone](https://dash.allinone.cash/): This project helps merchants consolidate assets through smart contracts, saving on transaction gas fees. It currently supports most major blockchains.

- Aorbit: This is a decentralized trading platform based on the solana chain, which anyone can view and buy.

During my free time, I also work on personal projects, striving to improve myself while making humble contributions to the Web3 ecosystem:

- [Cryptopayserver](https://github.com/cryptopayserver00/cryptopayserver): Accept Crypto payments. Free, open-source & self-hosted, Crypto payment processor. This project provides merchants with support for accepting cryptocurrencies, offering a free, open-source, and automated deployment solution. It currently supports multiple major blockchains and cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Litecoin, and Binance Smart Chain.

- [Deshop](https://github.com/deshopfun/deshop): Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. The design logic of this project draws inspiration from the [Pumpfun](https://pump.fun) platform, enabling anyone to publish content and sell it in various ways. Deshop allows anyone to list their products and conduct online transactions using cryptocurrency.

- [Predictmarket](https://github.com/viper-00/predictmarket): This project is inspired by [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) and aims to create a similar prediction market. It supports cross-chain operations for all major blockchains and assets, with the goal of becoming the largest prediction market in the world.

- [Nowcoin](https://github.com/viper-00/nowcoin): This project involves Telegram notifications and a block scanning service, setting up a platform for message alerts and notifications. Regular users can provide their addresses, and when funds are received in their accounts, they will receive notifications through third-party tools like email, Telegram, etc. The service ensures real-time updates with no delays and allows users to monitor the latest cryptocurrency price movements and market trends.
