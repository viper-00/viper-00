### Hello, Developers ðŸ‘‹

I am Viper, a highly experienced developer with a background in blockchain, Web3, NFT, DeFi, and wallet-related projects. I am proficient in various programming languages, including Golang, JS/TS, Rust, Python, Solidity, and Shell.

Currently, I am part of the Aurtech development team, working as a full-stack engineer. We have launched several products: Aurpay, Aurbyt, AurMask, AllInOne, and Aorbit.

- [Aurpay](https://aurpay.net): This product enables merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments. It supports multiple blockchains such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Lightning Network, Ethereum, Tron, BSC, and various payment currencies like BTC, ETH, TRX, USDT, USDC, DAI, and BNB. Our e-commerce plugins are compatible with platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, Ecwid, BigCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, and Paid Memberships Pro. We have over 2,000 registered merchants, with around 500 active.

- Aurbyt: This product allows end-users to purchase stablecoins like USDC and supports all mainstream blockchains. We collaborated with the US service provider [Cricle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) to develop this cryptocurrency payment wallet. Aurbyt enables fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto transactions and supports user KYC verification.

- [AurMask](https://aurmask.net/): This wallet supports both same-chain and cross-chain transactions. It connects to Uniswap's exchange contract, leveraging its extensive market liquidity. Additionally, we have developed a set of cross-chain transaction methods, enabling currency exchanges both within the same blockchain and across different blockchains.

- [AllInone](https://dash.allinone.cash/): This project helps merchants consolidate assets through smart contracts, saving on transaction gas fees. It currently supports most major blockchains.

During my free time, I also work on personal projects, striving to improve myself while making humble contributions to the Web3 ecosystem:

- [Predictmarket](https://github.com/viper-00/predictmarket): This project is inspired by [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) and aims to create a similar prediction market. It supports cross-chain operations for all major blockchains and assets, with the goal of becoming the largest prediction market in the world. (**The project is currently on hold, but we plan to resume it in the future.**)

- Nowcoin: This project involves Telegram notifications and a block scanning service, setting up a platform for message alerts and notifications. Regular users can provide their addresses, and when funds are received in their accounts, they will receive notifications through third-party tools like email, Telegram, etc. The service ensures real-time updates with no delays and allows users to monitor the latest cryptocurrency price movements and market trends. (**The project is currently on hold, but we plan to resume it in the future.**)

- [Cryptopayserver](https://github.com/viper-00/cryptopayserver): This project provides merchants with support for accepting cryptocurrencies, offering a free, open-source, and automated deployment solution. It currently supports multiple major blockchains and cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Litecoin, and Binance Smart Chain. The project is continuously under development.
